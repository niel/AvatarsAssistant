This started as a way to learn to use Unity's UI Toolkit feature.
I thought it might be easier to start with a project already known to work and convert it from uGUI.
Pretty sure I was wrong ;-).

Despite having learned C# well over a decade ago, my experience with Unity is virtually zero, which has made this a huge learning exercise.

Anyhow, I started by converting DevilCult's ShroudModManager to use UITK. Now it is functionally equivalent I plan a couple tweaks and additions to it.
After that I have a few ideas for additional features to expand the usefulness overall.

Definite tweaks/additions:

* Ability to switch between Main and QA versions of SotA.
* Ability to start SotA or its Launcher with a button click.

Possible Future features:

* Backup key-mappings and window positions.
* Agriculture tracker to keep track of when watering/harvesting is needed.
* Crafting calculator. Tell you what could be made with current contents of inventory/Cost in materials to make an item.
