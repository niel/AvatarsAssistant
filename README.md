This started as a way to learn to use Unity's UI Toolkit feature.
I thought it might be easier to start with a project already known to work and convert it from uGUI.
Pretty sure I was wrong ;-).

Despite having learned C# well over a decade ago, my experience with Unity is virtually zero, which has made this a huge learning exercise.

Anyhow, I have started by converting DevilCult's ShroudModManager to use UITK. Once it is functionally equivalent I plan a couple tweaks and additions to it.
After that I have a few ideas for additional useful features (not for ModManager) to expand the usefulness overall.
